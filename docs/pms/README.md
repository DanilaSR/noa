# Passage of Particles through Matter Simulations (PMS) 

:warning: This component is under active development.

An introduction for differentiable programming for particle physics simulations is presented in the [notebook](differentiable_programming_pms.ipynb). Basic usage examples can be found in [functional tests](../../test/pms).

Physics model configuration files are available from [noa-pms-models](https://github.com/grinisrit/noa-pms-models). The current focus is on Muons and Taus, but we plan to cover a wider range of particles. To load the MDF settigns we rely on [pugixml](https://github.com/zeux/pugixml)  version `1.11` provided.
